> The Federal Tax Authority is reminding taxpayers to take advantage of the facility to re-determine administrative penalties on tax violations before 31st December, 2022. The decision outlines three conditions that must be met in order to benefit from the re-determination of administrative penalties imposed before 28th June, 2021. These include settling all due payable taxes by 31st December, 2022, with no remaining outstanding taxes by end of 2022 and paying 30 percent of the total unsettled administrative penalties imposed before 28th June, 2021, no later than 31st December, 2022. After this date, taxpayers will not be eligible for the facility and will have to pay their full penalty amount.
