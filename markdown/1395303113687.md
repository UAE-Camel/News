> The 50th anniversary of Japan-UAE diplomatic relations has been marked by increased official and cultural interactions. Emiratis have shown a growing interest in various elements of Japanese culture, such as manga, anime, sushi, tea ceremony, flower arrangement and martial arts. The number of food outlets offering Japanese foods in the UAE has increased by 163.4% in the past decade. Japan is assisting Emirati undergraduates to study degree courses in Japan and engaging Japanese experts and artists in the UAE’s National Strategy for the Cultural and Creative Industries. Emiratis no longer need a visa to visit Japan. High-level visits throughout the year culminated with H.H. Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan's visit to Tokyo in September, during which a Joint Declaration on the Implementation of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Initiative was signed. Japan-UAE joint decarbonisation projects will contribute to both countries’ climate agenda, while the UAE is ensuring stable supply of oil and gas to the global market. Bilateral trade figures show steady progress with exports from the UAE to Japan at US$27 billion and imports from Japan to the UAE US$7 billion. The success of Expo 2020 Dubai symbolised the UAE’s determination and efforts to connect the world together during a difficult time, with Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025 following suit.
