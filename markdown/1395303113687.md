> The 50th anniversary of Japan-UAE diplomatic relations has been marked by increased official and cultural interactions. Emiratis have shown a growing interest in various elements of Japanese culture, such as manga, anime, sushi, tea ceremony, flower arrangement and martial arts. There has also been a 163.4% increase in the number of food outlets offering Japanese food in the UAE over the past decade. Japan is assisting Emirati undergraduates to study degree courses in Japan through the Youth Ambassadors Programme (YAP). Additionally, Japan is engaging Japanese experts and artists in the UAE’s National Strategy for the Cultural and Creative Industries. Starting from November 1, 2022, Emiratis no longer need a visa to visit Japan. High-level visits throughout this year have further strengthened the bilateral strategic partnership and joint decarbonisation projects will contribute to both countries’ climate agenda. The UAE is also an important partner for energy security for Japan as it is currently the largest source of crude oil import for Japan. The success of Expo 2020 Dubai has symbolised the UAE’s determination to connect the world together during a difficult time and Japan is determined to make Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025 a great success too.
