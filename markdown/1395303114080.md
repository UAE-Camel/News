> Today marks a major milestone in Dubai‚Äôs infrastructure development as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) opened Phase I of the Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Improvement Corridor Project. The project extends from the intersection of Ras Al Khor with Dubai-Al Ain Road (Bu Kadra intersection) to the intersection of Ras Al Khor Road with Nad Al Hamar Road. The project includes widening the road from three to four lanes in each direction over a 4km sector, and opening all bridges leading to Dubai Creek Harbour extending 1730m, with a capacity of about 10,600 vehicles per hour. This will help reduce travel time from 20 minutes to about 7 minutes and enhance traffic safety and flow. Mattar Al Tayer, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, RTA, said that this project is part of an ongoing process to enhance the capacity of infrastructural components to support the strategic objectives of Dubai and serve development across the board. He added that Phase I included widening Ras Al Khor Road from three to four lanes in each direction, constructing a 2-lane service road along Ras Al Khor Road stretching 4.2 km, two main bridges with slopes extending 740m and 990m respectively, as well as a new 1.5km road of four lanes in each direction. Phase II will involve improving the intersection of Nad Al Hamar Road and Ras Al Khor Road such that its capacity increases to 30,000 vehicles per hour through constructing two-lane bridges extending 988m and 115m respectively, as well as a two-lane underpass extending 368m. Works also include widening existing turns as well as Ras Al Khor Road in the sector extending from Nad Al Hamar Road intersection to Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Road intersection. The completion of both phases will serve many major development projects inhabited by 650k persons such as The Lagoons, Dubai Creek, Meydan Horizon, Ras Al Khor, Al Wasl, and Nad Al Hamar Complex. It is expected that this project will have a positive impact on traffic flow in Dubai while providing better access for residents living near these developments.
